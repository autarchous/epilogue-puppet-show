      <p>
        <span class="lede">Mr Punch thoughtfully scratched his head</span> with
        his stick and stared philosophically at the four limp corpses in front
        of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "People may blame me," he reflected, "but what else could I have done?
        It is not as if these creatures had any real existence outside my own
        imagination. And surely I may be permitted to change my mind?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Here, for instance, is all that remains of my idea of Judy. Once she
        was my notion of a wife—a notion that I cherished as long as could
        reasonably be expected from a person of my imagination.
      </p>
      <p>She was a romantic conception, I am afraid, but for a time amusing.</p>
      <p>
        But I am too versatile to take delight for long in any one type of
        dream. The changes are too few, and as they become familiar, they begin
        to weary me. A man cannot live on a perpetual diet of sugar and cream.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Judy—well, it may have been in part my fault, but it seems to me now
        that the sugar lost its sweetness and the cream turned sour. No doubt my
        palate was cloyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But why do I speak in this metaphor? These creatures are those of the
        imagination, to whose command all the senses are but slaves. And it was
        not the senses that tired, but their master. We artists—"
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blk">
      <p>
        <span class="lede">Mr Punch paused,</span> gave his cap a slight rake,
        and, grounding the end of his stick on the floor, leaned one elbow on
        the top of it and crossed his legs.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We artists," he repeated, rolling his eyes, "can live only by variety.
        The new idea enthralls us for a time, but for that very reason we all
        too soon exhaust it.
      </p>
      <p>"Yet, God help me, what beautiful ideas have been mine!"</p>
      <p>
        He glanced thoughtfully at the drooping outline of the constable as he
        continued:
      </p>
      <p>
        "That idea of justice, now. What an exquisite conception it once
        appeared, and how trite it has become! I made the common mistake, I see,
        in the attempt to universalize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Universal justice! A magnificent idea, but in practice the thing is
        impossible, because your theory has to be administered by the lesser
        minds, dressed in a little brief authority.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="blk">
      <p>
        <span class="lede">"We give them a uniform,"</span> Mr Punch went on
        after an interval of ecstatic contemplation, gently thudding the corpse
        of the constable with his stick as he spoke—"we give them a uniform to
        show that they are the slaves of an idea. They learn by rote and act by
        habit; and so it is that the essence of the idea is squandered. For we
        others have passed on, and have no longer the inclination to renew it.
      </p>
<br/>
      <p class="drop-quote">I regret none of my killings</p>
<br/>
      <p>
        To us comes the moment and the conception. We make the religion and the
        law, and leave the lesser minds to their practice, which little by
        little falls steadily below the level of our inspiration until the last
        breath of it is dispersed.
      </p>
      <p>"But it is better so, for their automatism is the means of change.</p>
      <p>
        I regret none of my killings. Once the thought has been crystallized
        into expression, it must inevitably die inch by gradual inch. And if I
        had clung to these old notions of mine, I, too, would have suffered a
        slow paralysis."
      </p>
      <p>
        And with a sudden fury, Mr Punch began violently to belabor the dull
        body of the constable.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blk">
      <p>
        <span class="lede">"Oh, dead beyond any hope</span> of recovery," he
        remarked presently, wiping the sweat from his hands on Judy's skirt. "We
        can no longer abide this foolish pretense of human justice. It reeks of
        the Sunday-school and the solemn inanities of the law-courts. It is a
        cloak for humbug and a defense against the greed of the disinherited. I
        will rid my mind of it, and walk abroad once more a free man.
      </p>
      <p>
        "And with it goes, also, this foolish idea of retribution, this black
        menace of punishment decreed by some supernal judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Lord! that I should have spent my youth in terror, bowed under the
        threat of that idea! Yet I reverenced it. Even now I can see that it
        touches the superb. Without it, tragedy becomes but a poor, mechanical
        thing, a mere invention.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But you, also, my friend," Mr Punch continued, thoughtfully prodding
        the ribs of the flaccid executioner, "are revealed to me at last as no
        more than an invention on a higher plane of thought. Higher than mortal
        justice you were, because you represented the poetic inevitable. You, in
        your mask and sable, were the enigmatical emissary of the unseen gods,
        the unescapable monitor, the final sentence of doom, and, incidentally,
        a great begetter of proverbs. None could avoid you in the end. You were
        death on earth and hell in eternity. And by anything that is greater
        than I, I am well rid of you, oh, last of the manacles!"
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blk">
      <p>
        <span class="lede">For some time</span> after he had concluded this
        speech Mr Punch leaned on his stick and meditated profoundly. Then
        rousing himself, he glanced suspiciously at the clown who lay at the end
        of the row in an attitude that faintly suggested the histrionic.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Elusive creature!" Mr Punch apostrophized him; "how many times I have
        spared you! But I thank Heaven that I am nothing if not consistent.
        Shall I discard my old ideas one by one and leave this single notion of
        the joy of life to hamper me?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Impossible? For it comes to me, now, with a great certainty that I am
        at the beginning of a new road. No man can be as great and free as
        Zoroaster until he has discarded the idea of joy, so rightly tricked in
        the motley of a clown. And so long as I pay it one lingering tribute
        either of respect or desire, I am, myself, no more than a puppet and
        play-actor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But let me once be sure that this idea, also, has been truly and
        undeniably killed, and 1 can walk out of this loathsome prison that I
        have called home into the ultimate freedom of the enlightened."
      </p>
      <p>
        And, with that, Mr Punch spat upon his hands and took a strong hold of
        his stick. But as he was in the act of striking he paused to gaze with
        an earnest scrutiny at the drooping body of the clown.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blk">
      <p>
        <span class="lede">"But he is already dead,"</span> Mr Punch remarked a
        trifle uneasily. "Why, then, should I tire myself in so redundant a task
        as killing the slain? And yet shall I ever have peace of mind unless I
        am absolutely sure? Strange that I should have hesitated to make this
        last small sacrifice, I, the greatest of all men. Nor will I. None shall
        hereafter call me puppet."
      </p>
      <p>
        When he had assured himself of the death of the clown, Mr, Punch rested
        awhile to recover from the physical effort. His ears still rang with the
        sound of his own blows, and the virtue had momentarily gone out of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after a few minutes his pride began to reassert itself. He rose, and
        walked to the door. The sun was shining on the road. The world was open
        before him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "And now," said Mr Punch, tucking his stick jauntily under his arm,
        "what's to do?" He hesitated a moment before he could find the answer.
        Then, "Why, obviously," he said, "I must seek a new idea, and kill it."
      </p>
      <p>
        The tassel of his cap swung valiantly as he stepped over the threshold.
      </p>
      <p>And straightway the clown arose from the floor and followed him.</p>
